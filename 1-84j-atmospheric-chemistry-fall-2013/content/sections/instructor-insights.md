Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _1.84 Atmospheric Chemistry_ as it was taught by Professor Jesse Kroll in Fall 2013.

This class provides a detailed survey of the chemical reactions occurring in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, with a particular focus on those important for climate and air quality. The emphasis of the class is on the reactivity of key classes (families) of atmospheric species, with chemical/mechanistic complexity steadily increasing over the course of the semester. The emphasis of the lectures is on current topics of interest and results from the recent literature.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

To have a working understanding of the most important reactions (and their broad implications) in atmospheric chemistry, so that these can be applied within a wider context (laboratory/field measurements, modeling, etc).

Curriculum Information

- 10% Class presentation
- 30% Final project

Student Information
-------------------

![On average, fewer than 10 students take this course each time it is offered.](/coursemedia/1-84j-atmospheric-chemistry-fall-2013/bf2adfd468c3ca5b514bf6982f27ca17_1-84_stat_students.png)

### Breakdown by Year

Most students who take this course are graduate students, primarily from Ph.D. programs.

### Breakdown by Major

Students are mostly from the Civil and Environmental Engineering or Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences departments (~50-50 split); other departments include Chemical Engineering and Engineering Systems Division.

### Typical Student Background

A working understanding of college-level introductory chemistry.

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

Lecture
-------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 24 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   The midterm exam and final project presentations took place during class sessions in lieu of lecture.

Out of Class
------------

*   Read the [textbook excerpts]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/calendar)
*   Complete [homework assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments)
*   Study for the exam
*   Work on the [final project]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/projects)
